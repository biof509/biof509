Week 1
======


Week 1 will be a general introduction to the course and a refresher
on basic python programming.


Preparation
-----------

I would encourage everyone to bring a laptop to the classes to follow along. 
If you do not already have python installed the simplest way to set up your
computer is probably with the 
`Anaconda installer <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. Use the installer 
for python 3.5 appropriate for your operating system. 

We will be using python 3.5 throughout the course. If you already have a 
version of python 3 installed all the examples we go through will probably 
work without any errors. If you currently have a version of python 2 installed 
you may still be fine but errors are more likely and I would encourage you to 
either upgrade or create a python 3.5 environment specifically for this 
course. If you have previously used the anaconda installer a new environment 
can be created with::

    conda create -n py35 python=3.5 anaconda

The necessary command to activate this new environment will depend on your
`operating system <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/test-drive.html#managing-envs>`_.
